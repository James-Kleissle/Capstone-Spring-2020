---------
These are the files that were created when running and compliling code for android studio to run our first app. The first app version is nothing special and more for testing purposes to see if the code created worked and to see if it would run and create the app.



Description of Files 12/23/19
==========================================================================================================

AndroidManifest.xml
-------------------
The manifest file describes the fundamental characteristics of the app and defines each of its components. 
More information about app manifest files can be found here: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro

MainActivity.java
-----------------
This is the main activity. It's the entry point for your app. When you build and run your app, the system launches an instance of this Activity and loads its layout. 
More information about app activity files can be found here: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity

activity_main.xml
-----------------
This XML file defines the layout for the activity's user interface (UI). It contains a TextView element with the text "Hello, World!"
More information about the textview element can be found here: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView

build.gradle (Module: App) and build.gradle (Project: Capstone)
---------------------------------------------------------------
There are two files with this name: one for the project, "Project: Capstone," and one for the app module, "Module: app." Each module has its own build.gradle file, but this project currently has just one module. Use each module's build.file to control how the Gradle plugin builds your app. For more information about this file, see Configure your build.
Gradle plugin release notes can be found here: https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin
